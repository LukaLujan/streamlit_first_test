My first Streamlit application for loan approval. 
The app is not predicting perfectly because it was trained on a limited dataset from kaggle with only 614 rows , 10 columns with a lot of missing values, 
however the purpose of this was to learn how to deploy a model on Streamlit and handle all issues.
